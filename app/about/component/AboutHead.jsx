        About happy meat farm
      </h2>
      <h3 className="text-ternary font-medium leading-4">
        Happy Meat Farms was founded in 1998 when Ramona Bynes inherited a plot
        of land in Florida. Being an animal lover her whole life, she was always
        disgusted by the mistreatment and animal cruelty in the food industry.
        Ramona made it her life's mission to create a farm that gave animals the
        best quality of life, and to spread that farm into a world wide
        phenomenon. It wasn't an easy journey competing with name brand farms,
        and in 2014 Happy Meat Farms nearly went bankrupt. It wasn't until
        Ramona found a new partner that things turned around. Happy Meat Farms
        expanded in a new innovative direction, becoming the company you know
        and love today.
